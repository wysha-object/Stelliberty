## 📋 User Guide

### System Requirements

- **Windows**: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- **Linux**: Unverified
- **macOS**: Unverified

> ⚠️ **Platform Status**: Currently only tested on Windows. Linux and macOS support is unverified and may have incomplete functionality.

### Installation

**Download Options:**
- **Stable Version**: [Releases](https://github.com/Kindness-Kismet/stelliberty/releases)
- **Beta Version**: [Pre-releases](https://github.com/Kindness-Kismet/stelliberty/releases?q=prerelease%3Atrue) (latest features)

**Installation Methods (Windows):**

#### Option 1: Portable Version (ZIP Archive)
1. Download the `.zip` file from the release page
2. Extract to your desired location (e.g., `D:\Stelliberty`)
3. Run `stelliberty.exe` directly from the extracted folder
4. ✅ No installation required, fully portable

#### Option 2: Installer (EXE)
1. Download the `.exe` installer from the release page
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
3. Choose installation location (see restrictions below)
4. Launch the application from the desktop shortcut
5. ✅ Includes uninstaller and desktop shortcut

**Installation Directory Restrictions:**

The installer enforces the following path restrictions for security and stability:

- **System Drive (Usually C:)**:
  - ✅ Allowed: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\*` (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Stelliberty`)
  - ❌ Prohibited: System drive root directory (e.g., `C:\`)
  - ❌ Prohibited: All other paths on system drive
  
- **Other Drives (D:, E:, etc.)**:
  - ✅ No restrictions - Install anywhere you like
  - ✅ Root directories allowed (e.g., `D:\`, `E:\Stelliberty`)

> 💡 **Recommendation**: For best experience, install to non-system drives (e.g., `D:\Stelliberty`, `E:\Apps\Stelliberty`) to avoid potential permission issues.

> 📌 **Note**: The default installation path `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Stelliberty` requires no special permissions and is recommended for most users.

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues:

1. Enable **Application Logging** in **Settings** → **App Behavior**
2. Reproduce the issue to generate logs
3. Find log files in the `data` directory under the application installation directory
4. Remove any sensitive/private information from the logs
5. Create an issue on GitHub and attach the sanitized log file
6. Describe the problem and steps to reproduce

## 🛠️ For Developers

### Prerequisites

Before building this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Flutter SDK** (latest stable version recommended, minimum 3.38)
- **Rust toolchain** (latest stable version recommended, minimum 1.91)
- **Dart SDK** (included with Flutter)

> 📖 This guide assumes you are familiar with Flutter and Rust development. Installation instructions for these tools are not covered here.

### Dependencies Installation

#### 1. Install Script Dependencies

The prebuild script requires additional Dart packages:

```bash
cd scripts
dart pub get
```

#### 2. Install rinf CLI

Install the Rust-Flutter bridge tool globally:

```bash
cargo install rinf
```

#### 3. Install Project Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

#### 4. Generate Required Code

After installing dependencies, generate Rust-Flutter bindings and i18n translations:

```bash
# Generate Rust-Flutter bridge code
rinf gen

# Generate i18n translation files
dart run slang
```

> 💡 **Important**: These generation steps are required before building the project for the first time.

### Building the Project

#### Pre-build Preparation

**Always run the prebuild script before building the project:**

```bash
dart run scripts/prebuild.dart
```

**Prebuild script parameters:**

```bash
# Show help
dart run scripts/prebuild.dart --help

# Install Windows installer tool (Inno Setup)
dart run scripts/prebuild.dart --installer

# Android support (not implemented yet)
dart run scripts/prebuild.dart --android
```

**What does prebuild do?**

1. ✅ Cleans asset directories (preserves `test/` folder)
2. ✅ Compiles `stelliberty-service` (desktop service executable)
3. ✅ Copies platform-specific tray icons
4. ✅ Downloads latest Mihomo core binary
5. ✅ Downloads GeoIP/GeoSite data files

#### Quick Build

Use the build script to compile and package:

```bash
# Build Release version for current platform (default: ZIP only)
dart run scripts/build.dart

# Build with Debug version too
dart run scripts/build.dart --with-debug

# Build with installer package (Windows: ZIP + EXE)
dart run scripts/build.dart --with-installer

# Build installer only (Windows: EXE only)
dart run scripts/build.dart --installer-only

# Full build (Release + Debug, ZIP + EXE)
dart run scripts/build.dart --with-debug --with-installer

# Clean build
dart run scripts/build.dart --clean
```

**Build script parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `--with-debug` | Build both Release and Debug versions |
| `--with-installer` | Generate ZIP + platform installer (Windows: ZIP + EXE) |
| `--installer-only` | Generate platform installer only (Windows: EXE only) |
| `--clean` | Run `flutter clean` before building |
| `--android` | Build Android APK (not supported yet) |

**Output location:**

Built packages will be in `build/packages/`

#### Known Limitations

⚠️ **Platform Support Status**:

- ✅ **Windows**: Fully tested and supported
- ⚠️ **Linux**: Core functionality works, but system integration (service, auto-start) is unverified
- ⚠️ **macOS**: Core functionality works, but system integration is unverified
- ❌ **Android**: Not implemented yet

⚠️ **Unsupported Parameters**:

- `--android`: Android platform is not adapted yet

### Manual Development Workflow

#### Generate Rust-Flutter Bindings

After modifying Rust signal structs (with signal attributes):

```bash
rinf gen
```

> 📖 Rinf uses signal attributes on Rust structs to define messages, not `.proto` files. See [Rinf documentation](https://rinf.cunarist.com) for details.

#### Generate i18n Translations

After modifying translation files in `lib/i18n/strings/`:

```bash
dart run slang
```

#### Run Development Build

```bash
# Run prebuild first
dart run scripts/prebuild.dart

# Start development
flutter run
```

#### Development Testing

For developers, the project includes a test framework for isolated feature testing:

```bash
# Run override system test
flutter run --dart-define=TEST_TYPE=override

# Run IPC API test
flutter run --dart-define=TEST_TYPE=ipc-api
```

**Required test files** in `assets/test/`:
```
assets/test/
├── config/
│   └── test.yaml          # Test configuration file
├── override/
│   ├── 错误类型测试.js      # Error type testing script
│   └── 扩展脚本.js          # Extension script
└── output/
    └── final.yaml         # Expected output file
```

> 💡 **Note**: Test mode is only available in Debug builds and automatically disabled in Release mode.

Test implementations: `lib/dev_test/` (`override_test.dart`, `ipc_api_test.dart`)

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use (Windows)

If you encounter port conflicts:

```bash
# 1. Find the process using the port
netstat -ano | findstr :端口号

# 2. Kill the process (run as Administrator)
taskkill /F /PID XXX
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: Run Command Prompt as Administrator. Service-mode core processes require elevated privileges to terminate.

### Software Not Working Properly

**Path Requirements** (applies to both ZIP and EXE):

- Path should NOT contain special characters (except spaces)
- Path should NOT contain non-ASCII characters (e.g., Chinese characters)
- Spaces are supported: `D:\Program Files\Stelliberty` ✅

**EXE Installer Location Restrictions**:

If you used the EXE installer, additional location restrictions apply:

- **System Drive (C:)**: Only allowed in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\*`
- **Other Drives (D:, E:, etc.)**: No restrictions

> 💡 **Tip**: Use the **portable ZIP version** if you need to install to a location not allowed by the EXE installer. The ZIP version has no location restrictions, but may still be affected by system directory permissions (e.g., installing to `C:\Windows` or `C:\Program Files` may require administrator privileges).

### Missing Runtime Libraries (Windows)

If the application fails to start or crashes immediately on Windows, you may be missing required Visual C++ runtime libraries.

**Solution:**

Install Visual C++ runtimes: [vcredist - Visual C++ Redistributable Runtimes AIO](https://gitlab.com/stdout12/vcredist)
